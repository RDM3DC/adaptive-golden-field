Reference sheet summarizing available simulation modes and their scripts.

| Mode | Script | Description |
|------|--------|-------------|
| Inspiral | `inspiral_gwstyle_phi_a.py` | GW-style inspiral of rays over an adaptive field |
| Precessing Inspiral | `inspiral_precessing_phi_a.py` | Kerr-like periapsis precession |
| Multi-mode Ringdown | `ringdown_multimode.py` | Superposed damped oscillatory modes with focus correlation |
| Ringdown Lensing | `ringdown_lensing.py` | Single-mode lensing plus φ_a vs focus correlation |
| Stochastic Hybrid | `stochastic_hybrid_phi_a.py` | OU-noise-driven hybrid trajectory |
| Cinematic Cycle | `cinematic_adaptive_golden.py` | End-to-end animation from inspiral to ringdown |
| Spin Comparison | `spin_comparison_panel.py` | Static field vs spin-enhanced comparison panel |
